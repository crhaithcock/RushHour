Start with the combinatorial class: 2 cars, 2 trucks: Class ID 2**2*3**2 = 36


* Generate all states for the combinatorial class
* Save states to database
* Generate all connected components from those states
* Save connnected components to database
* For each connected component, generate its distance partition
* Update States/Components with distance partition information

* visualize combinatorial class
* visualize a component
    * Highlight a node and light up solution path
* visualize a neighborhood
* zoom in out and out through different scales
