        No algorithm required here. The struture of the distance partition gives us a clear way
        to construct all minimal solution paths. We simply follow all neighbors to next closer partition.
        We can select a single neighbor to create a single path, or select all neighbors to construct a
        connected subgraph from start node x to all minimally reachable solution nodes.
