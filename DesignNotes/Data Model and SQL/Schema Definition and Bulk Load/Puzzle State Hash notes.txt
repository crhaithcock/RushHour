Rush Hour Puzzle State Hash Notes


Part of the puzzle state data is the placement of the pieces on the RH board.

The purpose of the hash is to provide a piece of data for quickly detecting if two board configurations are identical.

There is an additional potential to use the hashes to determine if two puzzle states are neighbors in the state graph.

This document tracks the current state of the definition of this hash function.


version 1

Input: pieces arranged on the RH board

Output: 72 character string.

There are 2 characters for each square on the board.
The board positions are numbered from the top left to the bottom right as 1 through 36.

These are the possible values for a 2-char board space encoding:

'00' -- empty space
'2v' -- space occupied by a car with vertical orientation
'2h' -- space occupied by a car with horizontal orientation
'3v' -- space occupied by a truck with vertical orientation
'3h' -- space occupied by a truck with a horizontal orientation

Without proof, I offer that there is a one-to-one correspondence between board configurations and these 72-character strings.


Well, shoot. There is a problem in the claim above. Since the red car is distinguished, there are duplicate encodings due to one car
specially marked as the 'red car'. including the red car location with the above encoding appears to uniquely idenfify a board configuration.
